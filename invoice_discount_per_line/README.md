## Features

### 1. Fix Discount Per Line
Apply a fixed discount amount to an invoice line. This feature allows you to reduce the total amount of a specific line by a set monetary value, regardless of the quantity or unit price of the product.

### 2. Fix Discount Per Quantity
Define a fixed discount amount for each unit of a product in an invoice line. This feature ensures that the discount increases proportionally with the quantity of the product

### 3. Percentage Discount Per Line
Apply a discount as a percentage of the total amount for an invoice line. This option is ideal for dynamic pricing strategies where the discount scales with the line total.
